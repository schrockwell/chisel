h1. Chisel

Chisel is tool to generate simple, resource-based static Web sites. Hosting for a static Web site is cheap and easy to deploy. You'd like to take advantage of some conveniences offered by server-side frameworks (PHP, Ruby on Rails, etc.), but these solutions are overly complex and you don't want to devote server resources to a trivial application.

Enter Chisel. You get:

* *Nested page layouts* -- Because you hate Dreamweaver templates 
* *Resource-centric design* -- Similar to models in Ruby on Rails, but more flexible
* *Easy handling of relative paths* -- "../../../no/more"
* *Full ERB evaluation* -- Execute arbitrary code today!
* *Your favorite markup langauge* -- Interchange HTML, Textile, and Markdown

h2. Who are you?

You are...

* ...a Web developer familiar with HTML, CSS, JS, blah, blah, blah
* ...comfortable hacking around in Ruby
* ...fond of open-source software
* ...probably good-looking, smart, and funny

h1. Getting started

h2. First-timers

gem install chisel
git clone (url) demos
cd demos/blog
chisel -s

Go to http://localhost:4000/ in a Web browser (you use Lynx, don't you? I could tell) to see what you've done.

Here's a synopsis of the site's directory structure:

_config.yml - YAML site configuration file; use it to pass arbitrary data on to your site
_resources/ - Contains the pure Ruby resource class files
_views/ - Contains pages and partial pages that are rendered by Chisel
_views/_layout/ - Put your layouts here
_views/_layout/main.html.erb - A default layout
index.html.erb - Your very own home in Cyberspace

h2. Seasoned veterans

gem install chisel
mkdir facebook_two
cd facebook_two
chisel new
chisel -s

Point your Web browser of choice at http://localhost:4000/ to see your fancy new Chisel site.

h1. It's not a bug, it's a feature!

h2. How files are handled

* Every file to be evaluated must have a ".erb" extension
* Files and directories beginning with underscores are ignored
* Append markup languages as extensions, e.g.: about.html.textile.erb

Every page you want Chisel to evaluate must have a ".erb" extension. Every other file and directory will be copied blindly to the output directory, _except_ for files and directories beginning with an underscore (_). These have a special meaning to Chisel.

h1. Configuration options

* *output_dir* _(default: _output)_ - A string pointing to the directory that will contain the generated site. If you run Chisel directly on your Web server, you can configure output_dir to instantly publish your site.

That's it! Any other options you specify will be passed on to views in the @config variable.
